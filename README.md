# Baahn! ðŸš‚

`baahn` lets you find special connections saving money
when travelling with [Deutsche Bahn (DB)](https://bahn.de).
It's using [`hafas-client`] (huge thanks!) under the hood for
fetching information about journeys.

Suppose you plan to travel from `Berlin Hbf` to `Magdeburg Hbf`.
This package finds a longer journey containing the actual journey
from Berlin to Magdeburg but which is cheaper (yep, the DB price system is weeeird).

The output of the `baahn` web app:

## Installation

```shell
npm i @roehrt/baahn
```

## Example

```javascript
const { findJourneys } = require('@roehrt/baahn');
findJourneys('8011160', '8010224').then((data) => {
  console.log(require('util').inspect(data, {depth: null, colors: true}))
});
```
For finding the station ids [`hafas-client`] is recommended.
For everyday use consider using the [`baahn-cli`] package.

More information on how to use `findJourneys` can be found in the [`hafas-client`] docs:
[`journeys`](https://github.com/public-transport/hafas-client/blob/master/docs/journeys.md)
and `findJourneys` have the same signature and nearly the same return type and can therefore
be used interchangeably. The only additional property that `findJourneys` return is an optional
object `trick` storing how the price saving was achieved.
```typescript
interface BaahnJourney extends Journey {
  trick?: {
    prepend: Leg[],
    append: Leg[],
    oldPrice: number,
  }
}
```
- `oldPrice` stores the unoptimized price.
- `prepend` stores all legs that need to be **prepended** to the original journey.
- `append` stores all legs that need to be **appended** to the original journey.

## Known Problems
There are some complications with the recognition of cheaper journeys
caused by nearby/identical stations with different name, e.g. `Berlin Hbf`
and `Berlin Hbf (tief)` and _non-long-distance_ train stations. In fact if both - origin
and destination - are non-long-distance stations the search will never respond with an improved
price since the stations are missing in the adjacency list ([`stationGraph.json`](static/stationGraph.json)).

Feel free to add them via pull request but beware of the fact that a non-long-distance train
station should only be adjacent to long-distance train stations (even if in between are only non-long-distance stations).

spartan [FAQ](https://baahn.vercel.app/faq) (German).
